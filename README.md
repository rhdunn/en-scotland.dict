# Scottish English Dictionary

The [Scottish English Dictionary](en-scotland.dict) is a Scottish English
pronunciation dictionary.

Using John Wells' lexical sets, it has the following mergers:

 *  TRAP-BATH-PALM
 *  LOT-CLOTH-THOUGHT
 *  GOOSE-FOOT
 *  FACE-HAPPY

This accent also has the unmerged `NURSE` vowel, so `NURSE`, `BIRD` and `TERM`
have different vowels.

The context tags are defined in the `cainteoir.ttl` file of the
[pos-tags](https://github.com/rhdunn/pos-tags) project.
